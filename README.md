## The project
The goal was to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.<br>
Developing the Corporate Chat app I realized this could be an optimal solution for all those companies 
that want to keep job-related conversations apart from everyday conversations. 
Furthermore, the use of a Corporate Chat app could help the entire team to focus more easily.

I performed two main changes: <b>design modification</b> and <b>insertion of message delivery time</b>.

###Main features implemented developing the Corporate Chat project:
- Firebase incorporation (*Firebase Cloud Firestore*, *Firebase authentication package*)
- Animation implementation (*Flutter Hero widget*, *animation controller*)
- Streams
- ListViews
